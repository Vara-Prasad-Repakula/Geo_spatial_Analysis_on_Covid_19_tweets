## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a recent graduate from ***MSc in Data Science***, upskilling my self daily to land up in a ***data analyst*** job role to apply my skills which I always like to do. 
## What does this Project Includes ðŸ¤”
Python-based geospatial visualisation tool ( GeoPandas ) is used in this project to make geospatial visualisation for the greenhouse gas emission data and found various insights regarding different countries of the world based on geospatial visualisation. Secondly, Sentimental Analysis (including polarity and subjectivity) is performed on the tweets regarding covid-19 across the world and interpretations are made from the various geo-spatial visualisations. fundamentals of geospatial analysis and its visualisation using various techniques ( Mapbox, folium map, and Plotly) are learned from this project. Sentimental analysis of social media data using geo-spatial techniques (geocoding) and visualisations are performed in this research.
